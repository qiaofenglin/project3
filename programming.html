            I have been fond of computers since I was a child, especially logical thinking. When I was in high school, I often lost sleep when doing math problems. Even in my dreams, I was doing math problems. When I went to college, I often took computer classes in other classes. Self-taught, I learned a lot of complicated things, not systematic, but because of my love for computers, I got a better job in my career, and I like it because of my love.

            The first thing to say is that the learning of technology is a process of accumulation over time, from quantitative change to qualitative change. There is no way to make you become a big cow in a short period of time. The so-called step to the sky is reserved for those legendary geniuses, but geniuses After all, it is only a very small number of people. Most of the Daniel still rely on perseverance and perseverance, crowned with correct learning methods, and through continuous efforts, continuous learning, and spending a lot of energy to achieve their current achievements. So, when you read through the official documents, you actually only took a small step. To become a real big cow, you still need to work hard in your subsequent studies..

              Although there are a lot of dry articles on the blog, in most cases the knowledge system is relatively fragmented. Compared with books, it is not so systematic, and compared with video tutorials, it is not so intuitive, so put aside the documentation and For blog learning, we also need to study additional books or video tutorials according to our own situation.Some people feel that they can’t stop reading a book. My method is to set a small goal for yourself when reading a certain book, such as reading at least 20 pages of the book every day, so that you don’t learn too much every day. It is easy to make people anxious. Of course.........
