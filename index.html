              I will complete the iit course in the next 2 years, because I fill out the volunteers in the third year of high school and do not tick the option of obeying the allocation, so I am not going to the major that I want. In addition to taking the course of my own major in the university, because of my love for computers, I have to go to computer courses. So computer studies are also done. So getting a degree in the major I want is my dream............

              Make technology more in-depth and make management more advanced. According to the second theorem of thermodynamics, everything naturally tends to change from order to disorder, that is, the entropy value increases. And life needs to maintain itself at a stable and low level of entropy by constantly offsetting the positive entropy generated in its life. Life is based on negative entropy. With the increase of working years, you will find more and more deficiencies in yourself, and the entropy value of cognitive deficits will increase. Therefore, you can only identify the direction, adhere to self-disciplined life, and move towards artificial intelligence in the future
