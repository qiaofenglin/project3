              My resume

            <p>
              My name is Lin Qiaofeng. I was born in a small mountain village in China. I especially liked computers since I was a child. However, because my family was poor and didn't have any materials to learn, I went to college and taught myself a lot of programming languages, such as Java, python, PHP, golang, JS, CSS and so on. I also found a good job because I didn't learn ...........

              Programming is an art.

            I believe there are many such people. I was very interested when I first came into contact. As for such people, I think there is no way to suggest. Interest is the best teacher. As long as I am interested and willing to study, my technical level will gradually improve. Of course, I have one suggestion: pay attention to good health; A balanced life means that we have more than jobs in our lives There are several such friends around me. They were very good in college. C, computer and compilation are all full marks. They won the National Award in ACM. During college, they just like to write programs and do some new things. They are really incomparable. They go to big factories after graduation. Now they are estimated to earn millions a year. Let it go

            A passage I like
          </h2>
          <p>
            I like people who have experienced great storms and waves, but still calm like they just wet their trouser legs when it rains. Such a person has a calm power in his character, gentle and unhurried.All we learn in life is to make peace with ourselves; We go through thousands of experiences only to cultivate inner peace.
